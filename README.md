## Console-Based-Land_Rental_System-in-Python
Developed a comprehensive console-driven land rental application using Python that enables users to seamlessly rent and return land plots. The system is designed with a user-friendly interface that handles all rental operations programmatically, simulating a real-world rental process.
Core Functionalities:
1) Land Plot Rental: Users can browse available land plots and rent them by providing necessary details such as customer name, plot ID, and rental duration.

2) Return Handling: Upon return of the land plot, the system automatically verifies rental periods, calculates usage time, and checks for any overdue returns.

 3) Dynamic Billing System:
    - Calculates rental charges based on the number of days the land was rented.
    - Applies late return fines using a configurable penalty structure for overdue plots.
     
  4) Real-Time Invoice Generation:
    - Displays detailed billing information in the console.
    - Automatically generates formatted text invoices (.txt) summarizing rental and fine details for record-keeping.
